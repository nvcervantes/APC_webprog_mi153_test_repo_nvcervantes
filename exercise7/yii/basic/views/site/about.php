     <h1>Shierene &#9752</h1>
  <p>A bookworm whose favorite nocturnal hobby is reading.</p>
  <p> I am Shierene Cervantes, called Shie by my close friends, whom you cannot really know well without spending some time to get along with. Whenever I ask my friends what their first impressions to me were, they say either I do not look someone you could easily approach, an extremely girly person who only make friends to others in the same level as I am, a person who is so conscious about her appearance, and someone who gets easily annoyed. When people start to know who I am, most of them say that I am a sweet and very reserved girl who is lady-like in every way. </p>
  <p>However, there is more to me than just that. Unbelievable to some, my close friends know that once you get to really know me, your first impression would definitely change into a new perspective that is quite the opposite as your first. According to them, I am really a girly girl who has something you never thought I have to show off once I get really close to a person, and they are probably referring to my childlike attitude whenever I am with people I am comfortable with. They also say that I can easily get along with different kinds of people for I do not really choose the people I want to be friends with.
</p>
<p>Reading books, playing the piano, listening to really good music, seeing little children happy, shopping after a very stressful midterm or final week at school, getting high grades and making my parents proud are some of the things that can really make me happy. I have read a lot of books that inspired me in a lot of different ways and I find reading books really an interesting way to take you places you have never been.
</p>
<p>I am rarely impressed but eternally fascinated by everything. I know that it seems a bit absurd, but most people find me quite difficult to impress, and perhaps that is because my family always reminds to always strive to be the best even when I think I am already good enough. Nevertheless, I believe that everything God created is wonderful and worth appreciating.</p>
  <p>Hello, you!</p>
